# Aspire PHP Framework

Currently targeting: PHP 8.4+

Aspire is the working name for my new PHP framework that provides a SOLID foundation
for building modern web applications. It is designed to be modular, flexible, and
easy to use, while adhering to the latest best practices in PHP development.

## Purpose

I'm building this because:
- I believe the optimal architecture is a combination of ADR (Action-Domain-Responder) and a middleware pipeline (Mezzio-style);
- I want a framework that is lightweight and easy to understand, with a minimum of "magic" going on; and
- I know that the process of building this will be a great learning tool for me.

## Defining characteristics (in priority order)
 - Uses off-the-shelf libraries where a suitable one exists
 - Hybrid architecture (ADR + the ViewModel from MVVM)
 - Based around a middleware pipeline
 - SOLID object-oriented code
 - Standards-compliant code that is easy to read, write, and understand
 - Performant and scalable
 - Behavior-driven development (BDD)

## Planning

- Router: Symfony Routing component
- DI (PSR-11):
- Middleware:

- ORM (data mapper): Level-2/Maphper
- Templating engine: Level-2/Transphporm
- Need to find good authentication and RBAC libs
